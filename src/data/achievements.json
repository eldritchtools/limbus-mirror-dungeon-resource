Just bring your strongest team do the best you can.\n\nIf you're struggling, there's a number of things that can help:\n- Pick theme packs that have exclusive gifts for your team's main keyword(s). The fusions are especially useful, but the rest of the gifts are also good. Remember that you can choose theme packs using starlight now, so there's no reason for you to miss them.\n- Buy more starlight buffs at the beginning of the run. They can make a massive difference.\n- Avoid Refraction Railway theme packs. They add an additional +3 levels to all enemies on clear.\n- Avoid difficult theme packs (e.g. The Dream Ending and The Surrendered Witnessing are particularly hard because you have to fight Sancho and possibly Jia Qiu) or theme packs that counter your keyword (e.g. Murder on the WARP Express for Bleed or Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones for Sinking).\n- Try picking the least painful Mounting Trials at the end of every floor. Remember that 3 offense levels = 1 clash power. Picking +3 offense levels is better than picking +2 clash power. Also, unless you're using Sinking or have some other ways of reducing enemy SP, always avoid coin power.\n- Aim to fuse Lunar Memory after you've gotten all the important gifts for your keyword. Potentially dealing up to 4x damage speeds up fights a lot and reduces chances for enemies to damage you. You also stagger them much faster, which makes high atk weight E.G.Os incredibly useful to stagger entire waves at higher floors."

You also need to make sure that some of your sinners are damaged or have less than 45SP. If you have a lot of Cost to spend, you may need to have a lot of your sinners damaged.\n\nIf you have any of the gifts that have a chance to refund Cost when enhancing or refreshing in a shop, sell them if you plan to use enhance or refresh.\n\nIf you want to make the numbers slightly easier to compute, you can also sell the gifts that give you 30% discounts on refreshes, enhancements, or skill replacements\n\nYour goal is to buy/sell gifts, buy skill replacements, buy refreshes (both regular and keyword), and buy gift enhancements to make your cost a clean multiple of 100 (i.e. 100, 200, 300, etc). Ideally one that's not too high.\n\nOnce you hit that multiple of 100, you can spam the 'Heal Sinner' option until you have 0 Cost. This only works if you have damaged sinners or sinners at less than 45SP because the game disables the option if you don't. If you have only one damaged or sub-45SP sinner, spam the 'heal all sinners' option to give you more uses. Otherwise, always use the 'heal a specific sinner' option.\n\nIf you run out of sinners to heal but still have exactly 100 Cost, you can use the replace ids option to spend that last 100 Cost. If you still have more Cost, better luck on your next run.\n\nNote: If you plan to finish on F5 and have infinite mode on, the boss will reward you with Cost when you beat it even if you decline to continue into F6. I'm not sure if this will invalidate the achievement, but you might want to turn it off just in case."

The most ideal bosses to do this on are Shock Centipede and Skin Prophet (or specifically his candles) since they can't die immediately and are both fatal to Gloom.
